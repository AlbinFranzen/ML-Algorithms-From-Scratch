# Implementations of Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this repository I have collected various machine learning algorithms and recreated them from scratch using python and numpy. By doing so I have further increased my knowledge in the subject and improved my understanding of the mathematics behind machine learning. The repository is categorised into the following categories:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Supervised Learning**
- Regression
- Classification

**Unsupervised Learning**
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Association Rule Learning

**Model Optimisation**
- Ensemble Methods
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection and Assessment
- Parameter Optimisation Algorithms

**Deep Learning**
